# 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction – Machine Learning Web App

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning application designed to predict
housing prices in California based on key socio-economic and geographical features.

The solution covers the complete data science workflow — from data preprocessing
and exploratory data analysis to model training, evaluation, and deployment
as an interactive web application.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a regression-based machine learning model that can accurately predict
median house prices and make the results accessible through a user-friendly
web interface.
